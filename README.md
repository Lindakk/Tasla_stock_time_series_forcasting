# Tasla_stock_time_series_forcasting
Using neural network models to predict the stock trend of Talsa
Steps are:
1. Data preprocessing - Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Normalize or scale the data to ensure uniformity and improve model performance. Select features that have predictive power and are relevant to the task of stock trend prediction. Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively.
   
2. Model Selection  - Choose multiple neural network architectures for this prediction task, such as feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and gated recurrent units (GRUs).
   
3. Model Training - Train these neural network models using the training data, adjusting the model parameters to minimize the loss function. Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and network architecture, to optimize model performance. Monitor the model's performance on the validation set and use techniques such as early stopping and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.

4. Model Evaluation - Evaluate the trained model on the testing set to assess its performance in making accurate predictions. Calculate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or root mean squared error (RMSE) to quantify the model's performance. Compare the model's predictions to the actual values and visualize the results to gain insights into its strengths and weaknesses.
